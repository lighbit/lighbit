# Hi, I’m Lighbit 👋

Founder, product lead, and fullstack engineer.  
I build products that respect attention, emotion, and privacy.

I care about real daily use: mental health, money control, faith, focus, and music.  
Most of my work ships on Play Store and runs fully on-device, not in the cloud.

  • Local-only playback (no account, no upload, no tracking)

- **Blinq Life 🫀**  
  Daily mindful health tracker for mood, body, energy, sleep, habits, and recovery.  
  • Log how you actually feel, not just “steps”  
  • Spot patterns between stress, sleep, food, and focus  
  • Built for burnout prevention, not vanity metrics  
  Keywords: `wellness tracker`, `mood tracker`, `habit health journal`

  AI-supported journaling for emotional clarity and mental check-in.  
  • Private daily journal and emotional reflection  
  • Guided prompts when you don’t know what to say

  Keywords: `prayer times`, `worship tracker`, `faith habit`, `daily reminder`

- **Ecosystem link on Play Store**  
  All apps above are developed, maintained, and published under one builder identity, focused on privacy-first personal tools instead of adware junk.

🍱 Also building in food (physical products that still carry the same care)

- **Riuh Nasi Liwet**  
  Home-style rice set built around nostalgia and comfort. Small batch, warm, memory-driven.

- **Edelbox**  
  Curated food boxes for teams, founders, and busy professionals who don't have time to eat trash.

🎨 Product & UI Direction

- Expressive, adaptive UI (Material 3 style, dynamic color, motion, layered blur)  
- Mobile experiences that still feel premium offline  
- Flows that don’t hijack attention or spam you  
- Detail work in states like “now playing,” transitions, microcopy, and empty states  
- I design around how it feels to live with the product every day, not just how it screenshots

🧠 Tech I work with

- **Flutter** for multi-platform mobile UI at production scale  
- Advanced audio pipeline: background playback, smart crossfade/outro logic, on-device listening analysis, metadata parsing for hi-res formats  
- **Go (Gin, GORM)** for lean backend services and internal tooling  
- **Java Spring Boot** for finance-grade workflows, recurring billing logic, and transactional safety  
- Event-driven architecture, clean architecture, and DDD  
- Sync and recovery logic for user data that actually survives bad networks and cheap phones

🏦 Shipped into banking cores, fintech, health, manufacturing, and consumer wellness.  
Focus: emotional experience, predictable behavior, and user-owned data.
