# Hi, I’m Lighbit 👋

Founder, product lead, and fullstack engineer.  
I build products that respect attention, emotion, and privacy.

🎨 **Product & UI Direction**
- Expressive, adaptive UI (Material 3, dynamic color, motion, layered blur)  
- Mobile experiences that still feel premium offline  
- Flows that don’t gaslight the user or hijack attention  
- Detail work in states like “now playing,” transitions, microcopy, and empty states

🧠 **Tech I work with**
- **Flutter** for mobile and multi-platform UI  
- **Audio stack**: just_audio, AudioService, on-device analysis, FFmpeg-style metadata parsing, smart crossfade/outro logic  
- **Go (Gin, GORM)** for lightweight, reliable backend services  
- **Java Spring Boot** for finance-grade systems and integrations  
- **Event-driven architecture**, **clean architecture**, **DDD**, and data models built for sync & recovery, not just “happy path demo”

🏦 Built for banking cores, fintech, health, manufacturing, and consumer wellness.  
Focus: emotional experience, predictable behavior, and user-owned data.
